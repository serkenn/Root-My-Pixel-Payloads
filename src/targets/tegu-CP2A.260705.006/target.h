// tegu — Pixel 9a, Android 17
// Build: CP2A.260705.006
// Kernel: 6.1.157-android14-11-gbd23337e42e7-ab14791245  (KMI android14-6.1)
// Codename, build ID, fingerprint and kernel release above are confirmed
// against a physical Pixel 9a on this build.
//
// PROVENANCE
// ==========
// Two independent sources, both carved out of
// .factory-images/tegu-cp2a.260705.006/Image — no value below is inherited
// from another target and none is guessed:
//
//  1. Symbol addresses — kallsyms, recovered with vmlinux-to-elf (102271
//     symbols). Every symbol referenced here was resolved by name; nothing
//     was pattern-matched or approximated.
//
//  2. Struct member offsets — the kernel's own BTF blob, which is linked
//     into this image (CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y) and sits at file offset
//     0x01661000 (5653158 bytes, magic 0xeb9f). BTF is emitted by pahole
//     from the built vmlinux's DWARF, so it describes *this* build's real
//     layout — it is authoritative in a way kernel source is not, and it
//     already accounts for any layout randomization. (Moot here anyway:
//     CONFIG_RANDSTRUCT is not set in this build's embedded IKCONFIG.)
//
// tegu is the only android14-6.1 target in this repo; blazer/mustang/rango
// are all android15-6.6. Their struct offsets are NOT valid here and the
// differences are not subtle — see the DIVERGENCE notes below. Anything
// tagged "arch constant" is the one category that is neither a symbol nor a
// struct member, and is called out individually.
//
// STATUS: complete, self-consistent, and never run on hardware. Every value
// is sourced, but "sourced" is not "tested" — an exploit that gets a live
// kernel write wrong does not fail cleanly.

// DIVERGENCE from blazer (0xffffffc080000000). This is not a guess and not
// the vmlinux-to-elf "first symbol" fallback that happens to agree with it:
// on arm64, KIMAGE_VADDR == MODULES_END == _PAGE_END(VA_BITS_MIN) +
// MODULES_VSIZE. This build has CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS=39, so _PAGE_END is
// 0xffffffc000000000, and the 6.1 module region is 128MB — giving
// 0xffffffc008000000. blazer's 6.6 kernel uses the 2GB module region
// introduced later, hence its +0x80000000. Both fall out of the same

// DIVERGENCE: overrides common.h's 2 / 4, which are the 6.6 values. From this
// build's BTF, enum kmalloc_cache_type is
//   KMALLOC_NORMAL=0  KMALLOC_DMA=0  KMALLOC_CGROUP=1  KMALLOC_RECLAIM=2
//   NR_KMALLOC_TYPES=3
// KMALLOC_DMA collapses onto KMALLOC_NORMAL because CONFIG_ZONE_DMA is not set
// in this build (only CONFIG_ZONE_DMA32), which pulls CGROUP down to row 1.
// pipe_buffer arrays are allocated with GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT and so live in the
// CGROUP row; reading row 2 here would hand back the RECLAIM kmalloc-2048
// cache instead, and pipe_cache_matches() would never match. The row count
// matters too: KMALLOC_CACHE_SLOTS sizes the bulk read of kmalloc_caches, and
// 4 rows would read 112 bytes past the end of a 3-row array.
// Both values still hold even though this device boots with
// cgroup.memory=nokmem (see /proc/cmdline), which is why /proc/slabinfo lists
// only kmalloc-* and kmalloc-rcl-* and no kmalloc-cg-* at all. nokmem makes
// new_kmalloc_cache() alias the CGROUP row onto NORMAL rather than remove it,
// so the enum — and therefore the row count — is unchanged, row 1 is a valid
// cache pointer, and GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT pipe_buffer arrays land in that same
// cache. Do not "fix" this to 0 on the strength of the missing cg caches.
